# Rock Paper Scissors
 
A TUI Rock Paper Scissors game made with Ruscii (amazing TUI library) and Rand crates.
In another branch there is also a Python version. Although it's CLI and not TUI.
Right now there is annoying problem where it says Some() along with what ever the AI chose.
Maybe I'll fix it at some point.
